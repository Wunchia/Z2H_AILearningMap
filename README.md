# Z2H_AILearningMap

This is my repository aiming at learning AI knowledge from Zero to Hero. 
## Project Goals

This project aims to systematically study artificial intelligence from scratch, gradually mastering theory and practical skills related to AI. This includes:

* Mastering core concepts such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
* Familiarizing yourself with classic AI algorithms and models.
* Gaining the ability to use tools like Python for AI development.

## Learning Plan

My learning plan is primarily divided into the following stages:

1. **Fundamental Knowledge**: Python programming, mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Calculus), and data structures & algorithms.
2. **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, etc.
3. **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, etc.
4. **Paper Reproduction**: Reading classic papers such as AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, InceptionNet, seq2seq, and attempting to reproduce them.
